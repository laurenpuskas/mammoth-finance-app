# Mammoth Finance Take-Home Project

Running application: https://mammoth-finance.netlify.app

This is an example application that retrieves Github issues data from the [Mammoth Frontend](https://github.com/laurenpuskas/mammoth-frontend) and [Mammoth Backend](https://github.com/laurenpuskas/mammoth-backend) repositories.

This app retrieves combined issues from both repos, filters for issues labeled "authentication" or "payments," then displays the 'open' and 'total' number of issues for each label.

Set up:

```
git clone https://github.com/laurenpuskas/mammoth-finance-app
npm install
npm start
go to http://localhost:3000
```

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
